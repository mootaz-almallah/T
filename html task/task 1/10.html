    <p> There is debate over whether <i>mathmatical object</i>  such as numbers and points exist naturally or see banua crestines. The mathematician <b>benjamin Peires</b> called mathematics<q> the science that drows, necessary conclusion </q><mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, no the other hand, stated that <u><q>as far at the laws of mathematics cefectorality they are not certain and a far as they are certain they do not refer to reality.</p></u>
    <p><u> Today, mathematics is considered one of the most trusted tools in the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural sciences</u>, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with the application of <b>mathematical knowledge </b>to other fields, inspires and supports many mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians may engage in pure mathematics, otherwise known as theoretical mathematics."</P>
